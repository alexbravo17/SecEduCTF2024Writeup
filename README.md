## SECEdu CTF 2024 Writeup

These are challenges that I have done/attempted, along with help with my team UQCyberSquad_GOTO_hell

Week 1: Going off initial momentum, I manage to do quite a bit of challenges. These are also mostly easy (as intended) problems

Week 2: Got stuck at avatar, which locks the rest of the challenges. Nothing else I can do with that :/

Week 3: Forgot that there is a new week of challenges, so minimal time was invested sadly

Week 4: Real life commitments due to mid-sem break only allows minimal time again

Overall, it was fun!
